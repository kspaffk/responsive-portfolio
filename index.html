                        As a professional, I have worked in various IT roles for over
                        20 years. I love using technology to find ways to improve the lives 
                        of those I work with every day.

                        In my personal time, I love spending time with my wife and three 
                        children. I love playing basketball and play almost every week. I 
                        go on an annual backpacking trip and took my Beagle for the first 
                        time this year. I love working with my hands and enjoy taking 
                        things apart to learn how they work and putting them back together.
